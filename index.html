                    <p>
                        The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                        as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at

                    <p>
                        We want to inform you that whenever you
                        use our Service, in a case of an error in the app
                        we collect data and information (through third-party
                        products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                        include information such as your device Internet Protocol
                        (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                        configuration of the app when utilizing our Service,
                        the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
                        statistics.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> 
                    <p>
                        Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
                        commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
                        to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
                        stored on your device's internal memory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                        the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
                        “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                        You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
                        and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                        choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
                        portions of this Service.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Location</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        This permission is only used when the app is 
                        recording an outdoor sport (such as running or cycling).
                        The data it provides is used to calculate distance, 
                        calories burned, and draw the route on the map. 
                        The <b>background location permission</b> is required by 
                        the application, because everything described above 
                        is done in the background (without the app being on the screen). 
                        If some of these permissions are not granted, 
                        the application will not be able to do what
                        is described above. In any case, this information 
                        always remains on the device.

                    <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> 
                    <p>
                        We may employ third-party companies and
                        individuals due to the following reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

                        <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
                        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        We want to inform users of this Service
                        that these third parties have access to their Personal
                        Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
                        them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
                        disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        We value your trust in providing us your
                        Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                        acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
                        of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
                        storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot
                        guarantee its absolute security.

                        a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
